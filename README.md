# TKUS
Battlecode 2018

When pulling this repository make sure to place it in "...\Battlecode2018\bc18-scaffold-master".  It should create a new folder called TKUS which will be our bot.

The run.py is the main script that will run when our bot is compiled and used in the game.  Feel free to add extra files as needed (just make sure you import them in "run.py").

## To Do 
* Make robots attack enemy robots
* Make sure rockets don't land on top of each other
* Track computational time left (most players during the sprint tournament ran out of computation time)
* Decide on research strategy

## Nice to have
* Pathing algorithm (given a target a robot should be able to map the best route to that target)
* Focus fire (robots should be able to focus fire the same target to burn them down quicker and less time to heal)
* Kiting (robots should try to avoid enemy robot attacks)
* End of game tactic (if the game is about to end replicate ALL THE WORKERS)
* Workers should try to search for available karbonite starting from their location (to save computational time)
