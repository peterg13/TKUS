# TKUS
Battlecode 2018

When pulling this repository make sure to place it in "...\Battlecode2018\bc18-scaffold-master".  It should create a new folder called TKUS which will be our bot.

The run.py is the main script that will run when our bot is compiled and used in the game.  Feel free to add extra files as needed (just make sure you import them in "run.py").
